Drunk Chessboard

Executable has three start blocks that poke the following values:

 SOUNDR ($41)   = 0 - disable SIO sound
 SDMCTL (559)   = 0 - turn off screen
 DMACTL ($D400) = 0

Program starts at 401E.

Program starts by decompressing 405A-7FDE to various parts of memory.
Decompression routine has hooks for specifying new destination adresses
mid-stream. It looks like a simple RLE compression.

The end of the compressed stream self-modifies the decompression routine to
jump to $B7CA.

4037: 4C CA B7          JMP $B7CA    [$B7CA] = $A2

That address is at $7FDD in the compressed block.

Music Tempo:

30DA: A9 04             LDA #$03
30DC: 8D F9 33          STA $33F9    [$33F9]

$30DB is uncompressed from 4144 at start

Tempo conversion:

    3/50 * 60 = 18/5

Steadier but a little fast:

    7/2

Untouched RAM:

  263 - 27F
  2B5 - 2FF (Though 2E0-2E3 are RUNAD and INITAD)
  D14 - DBF
  FFC6 - FFF9

Credits screen:

  X register cycles 0 - FF - 0 which doesn't leave enough time for frame compute.
